# KalmanFilter
In optimal control theory aka </b>Linear Quadratic Estimator (LQE) </b>

Matlab implementation of the kalman filter/ extended kalman filter. 

1. H_data contains the raw height data
2. H_estimation is KF for Height estimation. duh!
3. main_call and FusionKalman is EKF for Orientation estimation.
4. Helper functions contains the math functions for the required kalman filter computation.
 
PS: I really need to work on my nomenclature of the files.
